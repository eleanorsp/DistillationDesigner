# DistillationDesigner

I wrote this McCabe Thiele Distillation Design program over 10 years ago. This was pre-ARC Objective C times. This open source release appears to work with the new ARC process but mileage may vary. 

~~I have compiled and run this using XCode v4.4 on a Mountain Lion 10.8 version of MacOS, it appears to work!~~
Better yet, I have it running in XCode v11.6! There are a tonne of deprecation warnings but it appears to run. 

Hope someone find this useful...

Enjoy and good luck! :-)
